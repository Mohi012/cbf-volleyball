                <li>Same person cannot serve continuously. Minimum of 3 players should serve (A, B, C) No single player
                    can serve consecutively and ⁠If A starts the serve, the next time he can serve is only after B, C
                    finishes (which is like A, B, C, A … and so on)
                </li>
                <li>Three players in front row and three players in back row</li>
                <li>You can legally pick the ball from the leg. Or touching any part of the body is legitimate. It is

                <li>In a situation where two players from both the teams are jumping simultaneously and the ball gets
                    dropped, close calls regarding whether the ball was smashed while on the net or in the opponent's
                    court should be ignored

                <li>If players from both teams touch the net, then it is Re-serve</li>
                <li>Main umpire will stand at the center pole Umpire decision is final in all regards (no question asked
                    and he is not entitled to give explanation. If team keeps arguing they will be disqualified period
                    and with 0-7 points)
                </li>
                <li>Umpire decision is final in postponing / continuing a game under the given circumstances. If any
                    team is in disagreement, then the opponent team will get a walkover 7-0.
                </li>
                <li>No substitutes as we picked a team of 6 only on participant demand. so if in case of injury you need
                    to play with 5 players
                </li>
                <li>Each team can request 2 timeouts per game (i.e. they can request halt of play), this can be any time
                    during the game. Each timeout is 2 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>As it is indoor game we don’t need any rotation of courts from start to end of the game (leagues)
                </li>
                <li>When a team is sending the ball to other side of the court it must pass over the net, even I picked
                    outside the court boundary
                </li>
                <li>While a ball carry is not allowed during the course of the game, players are allowed to pick the
                    ball with palms. Umpire decision is final regarding ball carry.
                </li>
                <li>Line umpire decisions are final. No challenges</li>
                <li>Leagues , playoffs will be played in 2 courts. Finals will be played only in 1 court</li>
                <li>If a dispute or an appeal is made, the game should still continue till the ball is on ground and
                    umpire will take a decision. If you hold the ball in middle of a play , point will automatically go
                    to other team as well as serve<br/><br/><br/></li>


                <li>If two teams are tied at same points then we will consider point rate (i.e. if a team wins the game
                    25- 18, they get 7 points and if they lose 17-25, they get -8 so on average, their point rate is -1)
                </li>
                <li>If teams are still tied at this point rate, then we will consider head on head winner (i.e.
                    whichever team won on its counterpart during the league will be qualified)
                </li>
                <li>All the teams are supposed to stick to timelines in completing the league matches. If for any
                    reason, team is not available to play the match then the opponent will get 5 points for every 10 min
                    delay
